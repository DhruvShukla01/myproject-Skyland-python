## In-Depth File Breakdown

### Part A: skyland.py

This file contains the main game controller and GUI setup. It includes the `Skyland` class, which initializes the game environment, obstacles, trophies, and AI-controlled enemies. The class manages player interactions and updates the game state.

### Part B: obstacles.py

This file defines the `Land`, `Trophy`, and `AI` classes. The `Land` class creates the landscape and obstacles. The `Trophy` class handles trophy creation, replacement, and collision detection. The `AI` class manages the behaviour of AI-controlled enemies.

### Part C: avatar.py

This file contains the `Avatar` class, which represents the player's character. The class handles avatar movement, collision detection with obstacles, and trophy collection.

### Part D: main.py

This script sets up the game's graphical user interface (GUI) using the `Tkinter` library. It creates a canvas to display game elements and initializes an instance of the `Skyland` class, representing the main game controller.
